--- assets/README.txt ---
Place the client's real assets here and replace the placeholder filenames used in index.html:
- hero.mp4 (short cinematic loop for hero)
- hero-poster.jpg (fallback poster image for hero video)
- showreel.mp4 (optional showreel)
- photo1.jpg .. photo8.jpg (project thumbnails / large images)
- logo.svg (brand logo)

Tips:
- Use web-optimized photos (JPEG/WebP) sized appropriately (1200-2400px on the long edge).
- For hero video keep it under 6-8MB and short (6-12s loop).
